# RSS Reader App

This is a very basic RSS reader app I've created using Laravel.

## Currently you can:

-   register an account and log in
-   add a site's URL and if it finds a feed, it will read through it and store all the posts
-   edit the site's name or delete a feed
-   view the latest 3 posts for that feed on the homepage
-   view all posts for a feed on the feed page

---

### Future functionality

-   Fetching any new posts for all your feeds when you log in
-   Marking a post as 'read'
-   Viewing all 'unread' posts
    -   with the ability to order the posts by site name or date
-   Defaulting the feed view to only show 'unread' posts
    -   but being able to filter and show all posts
