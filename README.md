# RSS Reader App

This is a very basic RSS reader app I've created using Laravel (originally 7, now 9).

Currently you can add an RSS feed and if it finds an XML file at {sitename}/feed, it will read through it and store the posts.

You can edit the site's name and URL that you want a feed from.

You can view the latest 3 posts for that feed on the homepage. You can view all posts for that feed on the feed page.
